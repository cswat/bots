# bots I made

(reddit) getPostsCommentsByTerms - when run, the console will intake a list of comma-separated terms and a list of comma-separated subreddits. The script will enumerate through the subreddits checking to see if posts or comments contain any of the listed terms. If there is a match, the url will be returned. 

(discord) logposting - The discord bot will run continuously and on new messages will check the start of the post for "!logpost." Upon seeing this phrase, it will superimpose text on a picture of a log (logpostingtemplate.png) and upload that picture. Requires discordBot.py and logposting.py.
